						<h2>Look: Warm Neutrals + Glossy Red Lips for Christmas Day</h2>
						<img src = "http://www.temptalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/look_12252014003.jpg">
						<p>I’ve grown so accustomed to having different eyeshadows on each eye that whenever I apply the same eyeshadows on each eye, I’m a bit taken aback by how it looks to match! I can’t say I wasn’t testing anything on Christmas (namely, the eyeshadows), but I did bring out some of my all-time favorites.</p>
						<h3>Eyes</h3>

						<p> ColourPop Tea Party applied to inner third of lid, both applied with a narrow brush as well as patted slightly with fingertips. ColourPop Solstice applied to the middle of lid using a medium-sized, eyeshadow brush. ColourPop Sequin applied to the outer third of the lid using the same brush as before. ColourPop To-a-T applied into the outer crease using a synthetic rounded crease brush and buffed above crease towards the brow bone. ColourPop Fleek/Effect (dark brown side) applied into outer crease and diffused slightly above crease. Burberry Trench was dusted underneath the brow bone as a highlighter with a fluffy blending brush. ColourPop Fleek/Effect (teal side) applied with an angled eyeliner brush to the lower lash line with ColourPop Sequin smudged underneath. I used Sephora Blonde Ambition on the water line to brighten.</p>
						<h3>Face</h3>

						<p>Guerlain Parure Gold (02 and 03 mixed equally) mixed with Kevyn Aucoin Celestial applied all-over the face with a flat-topped round, synthetic brush and buffed into the skin. I patted Urban Decay Naked Loose into the skin to help set and finish the base with a tapered powder brush. Tom Ford Love Lust was applied to cheeks to add warmth and color with a feathery blush brush. Kevyn Aucoin Starlight was dusted on top of cheek bones and down the bridge of the nose to highlight. Guerlain Wulong was lightly dusted all-over face to finish the look.</p>
						<h3>Lips</h3>
						<p>Chanel Dragon applied to lips</p>
