						<h3>submitted by: Anjum</h3>
							<p>inspiration: “Essentially, I was inspired to do this look when I was walking my dog a few weeks ago, and I saw a tree with these beautiful flowers on it and no leaves. Then I started talking to my dog (yes, that’s normal) saying that I should do a tutorial in which my eyes were flowers. That’s how it came about, all though the flowers I saw were different colors than what I used, just because the flowers were white and pink; kind of hard to do on the eye. So I brightened the colors, and there you go!”</p>
							<p>products used: MAC Soft Ochre Paint Pot, Urban Decay Woodstock Eyeliner, Bh Cosmetics 88 Matte Palette, Urban Decay Corrupt Eyeliner, Lancome Hypnose Drama Mascara, Maybelline Greatlash Mascara in Teal Appeal</p>
