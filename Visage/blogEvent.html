						<h2>Bobbi Brown Hot Collection for Spring 2015</h2>
						<img src = "http://www.temptalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/spring2015_bobbibrownhot001.jpg" width = "50%" height = "50%">
						<p>Bobbi Brown and Kate Upton team up to bring you the Hot Collection, with this season’s must-have items for looking and feeling confident. Inspired by Kate’s hometown in Florida, this collection pairs subtle nudes with pops of head-turning color. Think the warm nudes of the beachfront and the bright lights of Miami. Fun, effortless and vibrant, Bobbi carefully selected each shade and product in the collection to reflect Kate’s playful, beach-ready lifestyle. Pair a well-defined nude eye with a high-voltage lip for a look that channels hot summer days, sexy summer nights and Kate’s easy confidence.</p>
