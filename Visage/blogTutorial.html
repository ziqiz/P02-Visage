						<h2>Look: Starting the New Year with Smoky Eyes + Dazzling Lips</h2>
						<img src = "http://www.temptalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/look_jan2014nordstrom008.jpg" width = "50%" height = "50%">
						<p>The beginning of the new year is always an optimistic time for me where everything just seems brighter, and I always feel renewed as a result! When Nordstrom reached out to work with me to create a look, those feelings inspired me to use different textures and finishes to brighten and add dimension to each feature. I went for a glittery, smoky eye with a pop of teal (you know me, when there’s a way to incorporate teal eyeliner, there’s no stopping me) paired with more neutral, subtle colors on cheeks and lips. You could easily make the look more dramatic by going for a deeper contour or substituting in a berry or plum blush. Similarly, any pop of color (or even a metallic silver!) would pair well with the eyeshadow colors, but I’m partial to teal, blue, and violet. If you want to be even more daring, try a plum or reddish lip instead; with the sparkle and lighter inner corner, it’s not a heavy smoky eye, and deeper lip colors could definitely pair with this look.</p>

						<h2>Look: Warm Neutrals & Glossy Red Lips for Christmas Day</h2>
						<img src = "http://www.temptalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/look_12252014003.jpg" width = "50%" height = "50%">
						<p>I’ve grown so accustomed to having different eyeshadows on each eye that whenever I apply the same eyeshadows on each eye, I’m a bit taken aback by how it looks to match! I can’t say I wasn’t testing anything on Christmas (namely, the eyeshadows), but I did bring out some of my all-time favorites. </p>
