					<p>With Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week for spring/summer 2015 past, and the first day of fall steadily fast approaching on September 22nd, now is a better time than ever to review the top fall beauty trends for 2014. Furs, oversized coats, even some ’60s and sports attire ran the runways during the 2014 fall/winter shows, but here’s what to expect when dressing your face this season:</p>
					<h3>Face</h3>
					<p>Skin stays illuminated for fall/winter, never falling flat or dull. Bronzer is even welcomed this season using it to help sculpt the face. Highlighter used on cheekbones warms up the skin to not look as frigid as it may be outside. Natural shades of blush are used mostly now, or a varied shade of merlot for those deep winter months.</p>
					<h3>Lips</h3>
					<p>Color is no longer just for the spring/summer months. It seems any shade of blue on the eyes; either applied as a shadow, thick winged liner, or smudged along the bottom lash line would make you perfectly on trend.etallic silver, bronze, and gold liquid shadows and liners are a must for winter. Match your eyelids to the way snow sparkles and you’ll be sure to shine at any holiday party.Liner goes wide this season. Seen on the runways, forget your perfect winged cat eye. Go over and out with your eye liner- over your crease and out past your eyebrow. Use the same color liquid liner to fill in the eyes. Think of a teardrop shape, but sideways. This eye trend looks like poised drama.</p>
					<h3>Eyes</h3>
					<p>The look for lips this season is very much dependent on what’s happening with the eyes. With so much drama happening with eyes, it’s best to keep lips subtle. If it is a simple black wing lining the eyes then go for lipstick shades of burgundy, velvet purple, or even classic red.Natural lips were everywhere during Fashion Week, all changing in tone to match the model’s natural skin tone. If browns start to bore you layer a shimmery pink gloss on top or go for matte pale pink lips.</p>
