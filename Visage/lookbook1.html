					<p>As demonstrated in this lookbook, at the 2015 spring, neutral eyes are still very popular this season, and it’s easy to understand why. Neutral shades, as in browns, peach etc are compatible with almost every eye color, every skin tone, every hair color and every lip color or dress color that you might have. Neutral-based palettes are, very adaptable palettes to work with, and can be heavy or soft and smoky.</p>
					<h3>Eyes And Lips Only</h3>
					<p>A major trend for 2015 is skipping makeup entirely except for the eyes and lips. Skincare is more important than ever with this trend. Use a good moisturizer to help your skin glow and apply your favorite eye shadow and lipstick. It gives you a natural look with pops of color. If you don’t want to go completely natural, opt for lightly tinted moisturizers which cover some flaws while still looking natural.</p>
					<h3>Plum And Dark Red Shades</h3>
					<p>With marsala (a deep, red wine shade) being the color of the year, it’s no surprise that marsala, plum and darker reds and pinks are all trending for 2015. Some celebrities are already embracing the trend. Some are focusing just on the eyes or lips while others are wearing the colors on both.</p>
					<h3>Matte</h3>
					<p>Bright, glossy colors definitely make an impact, but they’re not ideal for all occasions. Get ready to see more matte colors this year. With the darker shades being front and center, matte is actually perfect. The look is more professional and understated for the office while still making a bold statement. Of course, you can always top with clear gloss if you really want to change it up from day to night makeup.</p>
					<h3>Dewy Looks</h3>
					<p>The natural look doesn’t mean you have to skip makeup. The dewy trend means using natural looking makeup along with a luminizing powder or cream. A light application of shimmering bronzer also gives the same effect. This look is perfect all year and makes you look youthful and vibrant.</p>
					<p>Unlike some years, the makeup trends of 2015 are easy to achieve. Basically, think natural with just a touch of color on eyes and lips. It’s simple, yet elegant.</p>
